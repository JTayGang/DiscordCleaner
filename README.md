# DiscordCleaner
drop it in "C:\Users%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Discord" and then run it (may change depending which drive you have discord on)

It will delete all languages besides english, gut most of the "extra" feature modules, and delete old install folders. Drag the created shortcut onto your desktop to launch discord afterward.
